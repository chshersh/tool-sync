When adding links which point to resources within git repositories, like
supporting documentation, please reference a specific commit and avoid
linking directly to the master branch. This ensures that links reference a
specific point in time, rather than a document that may change over time.

See here for guidance on getting permanent links to files:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files

Please use the following format for linking documentation:
- [Usage]: <link>
- [Other doc]: <link>
